# Moshify-2.0

This project helped refine my frontend development skills, utilizing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. This project also required Adobe Photoshop. I created a web mockup, which helped me create a cloud hosting website from scratch. Great exercise in building a static website from the bottom up and using components, to build the elements of the site.

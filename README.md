# Moshify-2.0

This project helped refine my frontend development skills, utilizing HTML and CSS. This project also required Adobe Photoshop. I created a web mockup, which helped me create a cloud hosting website from scratch. Great exercise in building a website from the bottom up and using components to build the elements of the site.

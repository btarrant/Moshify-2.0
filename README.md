# Moshify-2.0
This project helped refine my frontend development skills, primarily utilizing HTML and CSS. This project also required Photoshop. I created a web mockup and then created a cloud hosting website from scratch. Great exercise in building a website from the bottom up and using components to build the elements of the site.
